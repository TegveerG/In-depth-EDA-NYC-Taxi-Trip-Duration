# In-depth EDA of the NYC Taxi Trip Duration dataset

The primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables. The dataset I have used contains 729322 observations, almost a half of the total observations present in the Kaggle Competition dataset.

Currently, the project does not have a modelling section yet, but I plan to include that soon using Regression techniques as well as Trees/Forests. However, the EDA performed is explained in much detail and with support from various sources collected about NYC traffic as well as taxi rules and regulations.

Also, note that this dataset is from 2016 and, since then, traffic rules may have been updated. Therefore, keeping the time frame in mind, I conducted my EDA in the most suitable manner to give truthful insights and, eventually, to create a fair model.
